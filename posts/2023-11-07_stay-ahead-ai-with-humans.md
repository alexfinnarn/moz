As AI encroaches on work that has traditionally been performed by humans, we are at a cross roads when deciding on 
what passions to follow and what professions to join. Only time will tell which of our passions harnessed by 
profession will prevail after the AI revolution, but I believe we all can prepare by doing one simple thing: be human.

## Dev Assembly Line

The Agile movement was in part created from the frustrations of developers who felt like their work was only 
important as the very last part of the assembly line. The "Waterfall methodology" is consistently contrasted with 
Agile as a method where every part of the plan flows in sequence like a waterfall. 

Project managers and designers were at the top of the waterfall, and the developer wondered how they could ascend 
the slippery rocks to get out of all the damn mist at the bottom. From the bottom of the waterfall, the top looked 
pretty good. At the top, the client stood looking down towards the mist, but the client never really noticed the end 
of the waterfall, they always looked past that roaring maelstrom. 

At the end of the assembly line, you don't really get a chance to influence the client much nor what you're building.
The requirements might make you do dev backflips whereas one conversation with the client would produce smooth yoga 
poses. And what's worse, the success of the project you're working on is granted to the ones closest to the client, 
but not the ones who had to make the solution work no matter what obstacles the people before them put in the way.

## The Rotary Phone and 411

To understand what's to become of the developer stuck at the end of the assembly line, let's look back in time at a 
similar transition that ended differently for two very similar occupations. 

Switchboard operators were crucial before the rotary phone existed. You picked up your phone and were greeted with 
an operator who knew how to connect you to another person or another switchboard operator. Without the helpful human 
on the other end of the line, you would have to write letters, send smoke signals, or physically go to the person 
you wanted to converse with. I can only imagine how this worked in larger cities, but for a small town, it 
conceptually makes sense and sounds quaint.

All that changed with the rotary phone, and almost overnight, no one needed the assistance of the helpful switchboard 
operator. People were perfectly fine with using their fingers to reach someone without a middleman. 

The only tangential profession that remained were the 411 operators. If you didn't know the number you were trying to 
reach, the rotary phone did you know good. You still had to talk to a human to help direct you to the proper number 
to call. By appealing to human flaws, the 411 operators were able to survive the transition to rotary phones that 
switchboard operators were not. 

It's taken about 70 years after the demise of switchboard operators for AI to take hold in the land of directory 
assistance. However, we still have the option to talk to a human if the assistant isn't getting it. I've grown 
accustomed to screaming "AGENT! AGENT!" into my phone as I pound the zero key, and I'm sure I'm not alone.

## Be Human

So what have we learned from the longevity of the 411 directory assistance operator? I think we've learned that by 
being the most human we can be duing work, we protect ourselves from being replaced by non-humans. At some point, if 
we don't start burning computers in a weird rebellion, we will all become some version of a cyborg, but the last 
people to be converted will be the ones who still take orders from regular humans. 

For the developer on the assembly line, this means they need to jump to the front of the line where they'll be most 
influential. They also need to embrace these new AI coding assistants and look at them as the mathematician looks at 
their calculator: creative thought never again shackled by mundane tasks.
