Ever since I was little, I had a fascination with superheros. I don't think my interest was any more fanatical than 
a typical child's interest as most kids have a favorite superhero. It's about Halloween now and I see kids running 
around in Spider-Man, Superman, Batman, or whatever other man...or woman...they want to be. 

Growing up, my siblings and I even created a superhero book of all our homegrown superheros. I wish I still had that 
book of illustrations and superpower synopses as I fondly remember inhabiting different characters while fighting my 
siblings and superhero nemesis. 

Throughout my childhood, I only thought of superheros as the good guys fighting the bad supervillians. But I never 
paused to consider why they were the good guys. Or even more perposterous, could the superhero actually be the bad 
guy? Well, in this post, I'll go over why I think I can be the last superhero you'll ever need. My superpower is 
insight, and after running through my training gauntlet, enough insight should rub off on you that reaching for the 
Bat Signal will never be a thing.

## Calling All Superheros

As an adult, the main thing I started wondering about superheros was why they exist in the first place? 

They supposedly have superpowers making them more fit to win in any fight against an average person, and they always 
seem to beat the bad guys proving that they can win in a more fair fight. And yet, we seem to keep having to call 
them back in times of crisis and dire needs.

Why? Why can't they step up to the plate earlier so things don't get so bad? Are they all extreme narcissists? 
Avoiding superhero narcissism is a whole 'nother topic, but it is strange how superheros can beat the bad guys only 
to wait for the next attack to occur. 

I think we shouldn't have to need superheros to live our daily lives in peace, and I'm beginning to get angry at all 
the people supporting and clapping for these "heros" instead of trying to whoop their ass so they actually do their job.

## Four Alarm Work Fire

Thinking about how arrogant most superheros are quickly led me to think about past work situations where I was 
embedded in a superhero culture. We didn't really follow best practices, but the client kept renewing the contract 
and most developers were okay with the way things were. 

Sure, we had plenty of "fires" come up, but one member of the team always seemed to be able to put them out. We'll 
call him "Waterman" for now...Originally I called him "Acquaman" until the Superfriends lawyer got to me.

After putting out the fire, Waterman never did much of anything to prevent the next one. He liked to sit in the back 
of the room sniffing for any smoke smells, but not really doing anything useful. Like, I don't know, fire-proofing 
the office. Maybe buy a fire extinguisher. Buy the devs some flame retardant jumpsuits. You know, things that 
prevent fires from getting out of hand. 

Instead, company leadership "Big Brains" all applauded his work. They weren't around when things were quiet, but 
they loved the sight of Waterman springing forth and putting out raging fires with avengance. I, however, was not 
impressed. To me, he was a water boy and not Waterman. I kept trying to whisper in Waterman's ears about how we 
could prevent the next fire if we were more careful, but Waterman never really paid much attention to me. Why should 
he when all the Big Brains were giving praise?

## Basketball Hotshots

I played basketball when I was younger, and I also have watched a fair share of basketball as an adult. The game is 
separated into offense and defense, but most players focus solely on offense. As a kid, I always spent my days 
imagining the ball was in my hands, five seconds were left on the clock, and I had to nail the fade away three to 
win the game. Nailing the shot only happened about 5% of the time, but let me tell you, the imaginary crowd went so 
wild, I didn't mind the 95% of time I had to try again.

At no point in time did I switch to playing imaginary defense. It's just not as much fun as shooting and hearing a 
swish. And yet every coach will tell you: defense wins championships. Defense allows your offense to have an off 
night and still win the game. Defense is selfless which can build teamwork whereas offense can separate and divide 
players...especiallly if their is a hot-shot on the team who hogs the ball all the time.

The office Waterman is certainly the ball hog of the office. He reminds me of Steph Curry shooting ridiculous threes 
and rarely plays defense well. If I were the coach, I'd be throwing chairs seeing his poor shot choices, and I'd be 
punishing the whole team until they learned to play great defence. 

## Professional Defence

So what does defence look like in a professional sense? How can you get rid of the Waterman on your team and prevent 
the fires that made Waterman so attractive to the Big Brains?

It starts with preparation. There's always work that can go into how you define what needs to be worked on. I 
loosely call this "systems thinking" in that every thing you do boils down to some system that you can model and 
perfect. Let's explore this concept with an example.

## Sensible Offense

Another thing superheros suck at is making themselves redundant. To excel at your job, it is always best to think 
and fit into your team complimenting others strengths. 

## Your Last Superhero


Notes:
- Concept is that super heros are bad not good, and super villains are good not bad
- If the system was actually working, then Batman would not be needed
- Rather than Batman fixing the system with the local government, he allows crime to happen so he can save the city
- The super villain is good since they point out the problems that can be fixed
- Batman allows crime to happen by choosing who to fight
