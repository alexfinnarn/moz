- wanted to load posts on the homepage
- started using htmx 
- decided to pull in the list of posts as a part of the homepage using htmx
- had a recursive call that kept loading the whole site within a div
- racked my brain, but htmx can solve this with `hx-select`
- then I had an issue with styling not applying to the new page content since the initial homepage request doesn't 
  have the posts list on it
- the components have a `<style>` tag above them but no wrapper
- adding a wrapper kind of defeats the KISS purpose and then the CSS would get weird fast
- I can solve this with
  - sending the list of CSS style tags in any htmx request `htmx:configRequest`
  - listening for that value on the server and merging in new style tags in the response
  - listening on the front-end for the returned style tags and then replacing the styles in the head
- Much simpler to use an "out-of-band" swap to automagically update the styles
  - this is easiest if the style tag is the first part of the `<body>` tag.
