I try to keep track of my finances just like most responsible adults do, and with the help of online tools it 
hasn't taken much effort for me to follow my transactions around. But since I use a free online service that
farms my data, it was inevitable that I'd have to look more into personal finance tools at some point. 

Well, since Mint is making me move to CreditKarma without keeping feature parity, I thought now would be a good
time for me to look into open source projects built around finance tracking. I don't use a lot of the features 
of Mint, and I'm mainly looking to see monthly trends for budget categories and net income. To be honest, I've
never actually looked through all the features of Mint and only focus on a few charts each time I log in. 

> Mint Closing Update: At first Mint announced that it would close down its budgeting app at the end of 2023. 
> More recently they announced that the site will be shutting down on March 23, 2024. You have until then to find 
> and switch to a new budgeting app.

I have a couple of months to switch to an alternative or maybe even complete a new application myself. 

## Open Source Mint Alternatives

My first stop for investigating Mint alternatives was a quick Duck Duck Go search. It lead me to a Reddit thread
with some good information: [Is there any selfhost-able alternative to mint.com?](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/83g9dv/is_there_any_selfhostable_alternative_to_mintcom/)
